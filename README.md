# Linear Regression Visualization with p5.js

This project implements a linear regression visualization using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. It is designed to provide an interactive learning experience for users interested in understanding linear regression and machine learning concepts.

## Stages

The project is divided into several stages, each adding new features and functionality:

### Stage 0: Basic Visualization
- Implements a basic linear regression visualization.
- Data points with higher costs are shown in red, while ones with lower cost are green.

### Stage 1: Linear Regression with Ordinary Least Squares
- Expands on Stage 0 by implementing linear regression with ordinary least squares.
- Points are colored based on their distance/cost from the optimal line.

### Stage 2: User Guessing Game
- Allows users to guess the line by clicking on start and end points.
- User's line is displayed in blue, while the actual line is shown in green.
- Scores the user based on the cost difference between their line and the optimal line.

### Stage 3: Dynamic Line Movement
- Adds sliders to move the line in x, y, and z directions.
- Cost updates dynamically as the line moves, providing real-time feedback.

## Usage
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
- Follow the instructions provided in each stage to interact with the visualization.

## Credits
- This project was inspired by the concepts discussed in "Linear Regression with Ordinary Least Squares Part 2" from Intelligence and Learning.
- Built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
